	<p>Your humble student has worked retail for the past few years, and gradually become known as the 'tech support guru' of his location. While he has enjoyed his time there, met many interesting people, and learned a wide variety of skills, he has finally decided it's time to make a change to an office job, mostly for financial stability but also so that he can exercise his mind, unlike most of the time in his current employment</p>
	<p>While there is still a great deal to learn, he has had some experience with Python and Java, and learned a smattering of HTML and CSS mostly from his old message board days and Geocities. He is greatly looking forward to all that he can learn in these, rather intense, six months.</p>
